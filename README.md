# LegalEase

The goal of this project/application is to use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), fine tuning and synthetic data generation to help anyone get a better understanding of the differenty property/zoning/housing laws for the town/city of the state that someone may reside in. Whether the individual is renting or the owner of a property, it can get really complicated really quickly to understand what laws/ordinances or other codes that you have to follow in your municipality. The state of New Jersey is a great example of an abundance of legal data to comb through for this subject, as there are 500+ municipalities.
